What we achieved:
- We have 3 providers Gemini, OpenAI, and claude
- We can call them independentaly
- We can load the splits of the SWE bench lite (might wanna configure to load other DS)
- We can debug the issues of each providers

Next steps:
- Introduce tools for providers, for sure access to the repo, crawling the repo
- Introduce test calling
